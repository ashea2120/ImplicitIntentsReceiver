This repository is for Lab 2 submission.
 
## 1.1 Implicit Intents Receiver 
 
This repo contains the project for Android Fundamentals 02.3 - Implicit Intents
 
## Issues and Lessons
 
A short description about the issues that you faced and the lessons that you learned.
 
- Main point for this "separate" project was to learn how to receive an implicit intent from a different app
- Leanred how to send an implicit intent from Implicit Intents and how to receive/respond to it
- When I added the <intent-filter> to the XML, there was a weird error that the instructor decided could be ignored. The app still functions as it should.
